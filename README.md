# unlib.js

> Although the library may be useful for solving real life problems, it has been created primarily for educational purposes.

The content of **unlib.js** originates from various JavaScript interview tasks, and therefore provides information on different algorithms and coding techniques. You are encouraged to contribute to the knowledge, including:

1. Suggest new functionality via Issues
2. Write new or work on existing implementations
3. Add new tests; we use Jest
4. Analyze and improve performance of library functions
